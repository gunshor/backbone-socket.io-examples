# Backbone Examples

## What's in here:

1. **Twittermap** - Fetches data from Twitter to post geo-tweets on to a styled google map. Uses Backbone.
2. **Backbone Blog** - A blog directed by a Backbone router to dynamically traverse content. Uses Backbone and Socket.IO (to push down articles).
3. **Patchwork (Very experimental)** - Connects users together to share code by dragging and dropping files into the browser. I have to say this is extremely testy and nowhere near completion. However I wanted to go ahead and post it and I will continue to improve it over time. I recommend using Chrome for this one.

## Getting Started

1. [Install node](http://nodejs.org/#download)

Most of these examples rely on an NPM package called backbone-server. This package is an currenly nothing more than an abstraction on top of Express to lower the amount of code required to configure an Express server. For more information on backbone-server, [visit the Github page](https://github.com/nhunzaker/backbone-server).

## Questions?

I understand that there may be portions of these examples which require further clarification. Please let me know if anything requires additional explanation and I will happily comply.
